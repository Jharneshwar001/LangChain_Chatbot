# LangChain_Chatbot
Developed an AI-powered chatbot using Python, Langchain, OpenAI, and Pinecone to enable users to interact with and extract information from documents. The system loads documents from a specified directory, splits them into smaller chunks, creates embeddings using OpenAI's models, and stores them in a Pinecone vector database. The chatbot can then answer user queries based on the semantic similarity between the query and the document content, providing a conversational interface for document analysis and retrieval.
